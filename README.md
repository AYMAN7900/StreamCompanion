o!StreamCompanion is a program directed towards osu! streamers.

### Functions 
  - Grabbing song title ANYWHERE you are in osu!  
  - Customisable map outputs
  - Key counter - how many times you clicked these 2 osu! keys since...(beginning of the stream?)
  - Play/Retry counter
  - Mods display
  - [osu!Post][osuPost] integration
  - Magic(and more)

### Help!
StreamCompanion now has wiki explaining most of its functionality. Give it a read if you are having problems or wish to know what SC can do. [Click here][wiki]


#### Functions "on hold"
these used to be included before but I decided to remove them because of how horribly they seemed to work.
  - Twitch to osu! chat Relay
  - Built-in IRC twitch chat bot

Any contributions / constructive criticism is appreciated
