# Mods image generator

This tab is used for configuring generation of image that displays your currently used mods

![l][settingsModImage]  

Generated image will be saved in the `Files` output folder as "**ModImage.png**".  

Note that **this image is empty when not playing a map**, so to be able to configure its position in OBS you'll need to start playing some map in osu! with any mod and pause it, for it to be displayed properly in OBS.

## Changing default mod icons

Individual mod images used for generation are saved in SC output directory in "Images" folder.  
You can freely replace them with mods from your currently used skin if you wish so, but remember to update "Mods Images width" and "Mods Images height" to correct values.  
If mod image doesn't exist in Images folder then it is simply ignored in generation.
