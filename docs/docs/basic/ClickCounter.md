# Click counter

This tab is used for configuring tracking of keyboard and mouse clicks.  

![l][ClickCounter]


::: warning 
**For best experience it is recommended to use [OBS plugin](./AdditionalPlugins.md#obs-plugin) to read these values.**  
That is because OBS has noticeable read delay when using normal text files, so counts won't be updating in obs as often as they should.
